BPNN
====

Use the BP algorithm to train a Neural network, and provide many trick to make the Net converge quickly and make net has generalization ability. 

The BP algorithm is very powerfull in trainning a network, but there are some trick can be used to make the perfomance be more powerfull.

First, I will provide the Normalize iterm which is the norm of the weight of the net

Second, I will use the impluse item to make the progress more smoth 

Third, I will use the batch size which start from a rondm point of the train-sample-space, to make the stochastic grident more stable.

Fourth, I will provide a trick on the net learnning rate which will change during the trainning progress

The last and the most important thing is that, I will let the net can be used in a way that what you should do is just configuring the file.
